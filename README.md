Assignment_3 - Stastistics
==========================
This assignment entails conducting statistical analysis on two algorithms utilized in Research Track 1, Assignment 1, with the objective of collecting all tokens into a unified location. The task involves iterating through 40 steps to conduct the experiment and analyzing the results using t-test statistical tools to either reject or accept the null and alternative hypotheses. Throughout the collected data, the environment randomly alters set tokens, resulting in variations. To evaluate performance, we consider both the time required to complete the task and the percentage of success rate. Utilizing a two-sample t-test, we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative. Consequently, we ascertain which algorithm outperforms the other based on these two parameters.
